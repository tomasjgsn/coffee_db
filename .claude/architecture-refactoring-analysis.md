### Option 5: Desktop Application
**Native or Electron-based desktop app**

**Architecture:**
```
Desktop Application
├── Native UI framework (Qt/Tkinter/Electron)

## 🚀 Strategic Migration Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)
**Regardless of final choice - do this first:**
- Extract business logic from UI
- Create proper data models  
- Add comprehensive testing
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

**Immediate benefits:**
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Faster development of new features
- Better code reusability
- Testable business logic

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision (Month 2)
**Decision criteria by priority use cases:**

**If staying simple:** → Incremental Streamlit refactoring
- Primary goal is maintainability
- Single-user use case sufficient
- Want to preserve current simplicity
- Limited development time

**If needing API:** → Hybrid approach
- Need API for future integrations
- Want mobile access eventually
- Comfortable with moderate complexity increase
- Value gradual migration path

**If going production:** → Modern web stack
- Multi-user collaboration required
- Professional production deployment needed
- Have frontend development expertise
- Long-term strategic investment

### Phase 3: Implementation (Months 3-6)
**Gradual migration strategy:**
- Build new architecture alongside existing
- Feature-by-feature migration
- Maintain existing functionality throughout
- User acceptance testing at each stage

## 🚨 Current Architecture Problems

**Single File Issues:**
- 1400+ lines violating single responsibility
- UI rendering, data processing, business logic all mixed
- Hard to test, debug, and maintain
- Changes in one area break others

**Streamlit Limitations:**
- Session state management gets complex with multiple workflows
- Form handling becomes unwieldy 
- No proper separation of concerns
- Difficult to add automated testing
- Limited mobile responsiveness
- Single-user architecture

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Start with Phase 1 regardless of final architecture choice** - extracting business logic provides immediate benefits and makes any subsequent migration easier

2. **The 1400+ line single file is a clear signal it's time to refactor** - this level of complexity indicates the application has outgrown its current structure

3. **Consider future use cases when choosing approach** - if you anticipate multi-user or mobile needs, plan for them now rather than refactoring again later

4. **Gradual migration reduces risk** - whatever approach is chosen, migrate incrementally while maintaining existing functionality

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Extract unified bean selection components into separate service classes
2. **Short-term:** Decide on architecture based on 6-month use case priorities  
3. **Medium-term:** Implement chosen architecture with gradual migration
4. **Long-term:** Scale and extend based on actual usage patterns
